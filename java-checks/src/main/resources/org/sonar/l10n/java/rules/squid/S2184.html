<p>When arithmetic is performed on <code>int</code>s, the result will always be an <code>int</code>. You can assign that result to a <code>long</code>, <code>double</code>, or <code>float</code> with automatic type conversion, but having started as an <code>int</code>, the result will likely not be what you expect.</p>

<p>For instance, if the result of <code>int</code> division is assigned to a floating-point variable, precision will have been lost before the assignment. Likewise, if the result of multiplication is assigned to a <code>long</code>, it may have already overflowed before the assignment.</p>

<p>In either case, the result will not be what was expected. Instead, at least one operand should be cast or promoted to the final type before the operation takes place.</p>

<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
float twoThirds = 2/3; // Noncompliant; int division. Yields 0.0
long millisInYear = 1000*3600*24*365; // Noncompliant; int multiplication. Yields 1471228928
long bigNum = Integer.MAX_VALUE + 2; // Noncompliant. Yields -2147483647
</pre>

<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
float twoThirds = 2f/3; // 2 promoted to float. Yields 0.6666667
long millisInYear = 1000L*3600*24*365; // 1000 promoted to long. Yields 31536000000
long bigNum = Integer.MAX_VALUE + 2L; // 2 promoted to long. Yields 2147483649
</pre>
or
<pre>
float twoThirds = (float)2/3; // 2 cast to float
long millisInYear = (long)1000*3600*24*365; // 1000 cast to long
long bigNum = (long)Integer.MAX_VALUE + 2;
</pre>

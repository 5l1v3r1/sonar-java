<p>A class that grows too much tends to aggregate too many responsibilities </p>
<p>and inevitably becomes harder to understand and therefore to maintain. </p>
<p>Above a specific threshold, it is strongly advised to refactor the class </p>
<p>into smaller ones which focus on well defined topics.</p>

<p>
  There is no reason to have a <code>main</code> method in a web application.
  It may have been useful for debugging during application development,
  but such a method should never make it into production.
  Because of the kinds of things that are typically tested from <code>main</code>,
  if it does make it into production, it could become the open door an attacker saunters right through.
</p>
<p>
  This rule raises an issue when a <code>main</code> method is found in a servlet or an EJB.

<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
public class MyServlet extends HttpServlet {
  public void doGet(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse res) throws ServletException, IOException {
    if (userIsAuthorized(req)) {
      updatePrices(req);
    }
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) { // Noncompliant
    updatePrices(req);
  }
}
</pre>

<p>Because it is easy to extract strings from a compiled application, credentials should never be hard-coded. Do so, and they're almost guaranteed to end up in the hands of an attacker. This is particularly true for applications that are distributed.</p>
<p>Credentials should be stored outside of the code in a strongly-protected encrypted configuration file or database.</p>
<p>This rule flags instances of hard-coded credentials used in database and LDAP connections.</p>

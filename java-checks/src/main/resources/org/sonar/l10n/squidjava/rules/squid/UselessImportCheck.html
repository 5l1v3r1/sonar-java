<p>
The imports part of a file should be handled by the Integrated Development Environment (IDE), not manually by the developer.
Unused imports should not occur if that is the case.
Leaving them reduces the code's readability as their presence can be confusing.
</p>

<p>The following code snippet illustrates this rule:</p>

<pre>
import java.io.File;   // Non-Compliant - should be removed

class EmptyClass {
}
</pre>

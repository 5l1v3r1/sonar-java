Even if checked exceptions were thought to be a great feature when they were introduced in Java, their usage progressively became controversial.
</p>

<p>
In theory, the purpose of checked exceptions is to ensure that errors will be dealt with, either by propagating them or by handling them.
In practice, checked exceptions negatively impact the readability of source code by spreading this error handling/propagation logic everywhere.
</p>

<p>
This rule verifies that no method throws a checked exception.
As a reminder, any <code>Exception</code> which is not a <code>RuntimeException</code> is a checked one.
</p>

<p>The following code snippet illustrates this rule:</p>

<pre>
public void myMethod1() throws IOException { /* ... */}               // Non-Compliant

public void myMethod2() throws IllegalArgumentException { /* ... */ } // Compliant - IllegalArgumentException is unchecked
</pre>

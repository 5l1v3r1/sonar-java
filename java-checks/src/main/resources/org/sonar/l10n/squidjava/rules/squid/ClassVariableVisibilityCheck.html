<p>
Encapsulation if one of the four OOP principles along with Inheritance, abstraction and polymorphism.
Limiting as much as possible the visibility of class members is one way to enforce this principle.
</p>

<p>
The following code snippet illustrates this rule when the authorized visibility is set to <code>private</code>:
</p>

<pre>
public class MyClass {

  public static final Logger logger = LogManager.getLogger(MyApp.class);     // Compliant - static final fields are always allowed

  private String status;                                                     // Compliant

  public int level;                                                          // Non-Compliant

}
</pre>

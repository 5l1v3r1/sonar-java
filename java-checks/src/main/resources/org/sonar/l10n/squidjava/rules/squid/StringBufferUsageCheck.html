<p>
As of release JDK 5, the class StringBuffer has been supplemented with an equivalent class designed for use by a single thread, StringBuilder.
The StringBuilder class should generally be used in preference to this one, as it supports all of the same operations but it is faster, as it performs no synchronization.

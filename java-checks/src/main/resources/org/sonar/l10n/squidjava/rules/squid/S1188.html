<p>
While waiting for support of closure in Java, anonymous classes is the most convenient way to inject a behavior without having to create a dedicated class.
But those anonymous inner classes should be used only if the behavior can be accomplished in a few lines.
With more complex code, a named class is called for.

<p>The following code snippet illustrates this rule with a threshold of 5:</p>

<pre>
button.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {   // Non-Compliant - 6 lines till closing '}'
  public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
    doSomething1();
    doSomething2();
  }
});
</pre>

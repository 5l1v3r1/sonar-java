<p>Overriding a method just to call the same method from the super class without performing any other actions is useless and misleading.</p>

<p>The following code snippet illustrates this rule:</p>

<pre>
public void doSomething() {              // Non-Compliant
  super.doSomething();
}

public boolean isLegal(Action action) {  // Non-Compliant
  return super.isLegal(action)
}

public boolean do(Action action) {       // Compliant
  doSomething(action);
  return super.isLegal(action)
}

@Id
public int getId() {                     // Compliant as there is an annotation (other than @Override, @Deprecated, and @SuppressWarnings)
  return super.getId()
}
</pre>

Sharing some naming conventions is a key point to make it possible for a team to efficiently collaborate. This rule allows to check that all constant names match a provided regular expression.

<p>
The following code snippet illustrates this rule:
</p>
<pre>
public class MyClass {
  public static final FIRST = 1; // Compliant
  public static final second = 2; // Non-Compliant
}

public enum MyEnum {
  FIRST, // Compliant
  second; // Non-Compliant
}
</pre>

<p>
Shadowing fields with a local variable is a bad practice reducing code readability: It makes it confusing to know whether the field or the variable is referenced.
</p>

<p>
Note that this rule allows constructor and setter parameters to be named identically to fields.
</p>

<p>
The following code illustrates this rule:
</p>

<pre>
class Foo {
  public int myField;

  public Foo(int myField) {                   // Compliant - shadowing is allowed in constructors
    this.myField = myField;
  }

  public void setMyField(int myField) {       // Compliant - shadowing is allowd in setters
    this.myField = myField;
  }

  @Override
  public String toString() {
    int myField = 0;                          // Non-Compliant - should be renamed
    return "Foo{MyField: " + myField + "}";
  }
}
</pre>

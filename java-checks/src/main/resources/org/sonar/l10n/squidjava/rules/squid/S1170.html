<p>
Making a constant just <code>final</code> as opposed to <code>static final</code> leads to duplicating its value for every instance of the class,
uselessly increasing the amount of memory required to execute the application.
</p>

<p>The following code:</p>

<pre>
public class Myclass {
  public final THRESHOLD = 3;           // Non-Compliant
}
</pre>

<p>should be refactored into:</p>

<pre>
public class Myclass {
  public static final THRESHOLD = 3;    // Compliant
}
</pre>

<p>Catching an exception only to immediately rethrow it without doing anything else is useless and misleading.</p>

<p>The following code snippet illustrates this rule:</p>

<pre>
try {
  /* ... */
} catch (Exception e) {                   // Non-Compliant
  throw e;
}
</pre>

<p>
When all instances of a general exception must be handled, but some specific ones not, propagation must be used.
Propagation is allowed by this rule.
</p>

<p>
For example, the following code logs all <code>Exception</code> exceptions which are not <code>RuntimeException</code>.
All <code>RuntimeException</code> exceptions are propagated.
</p>

<pre>
try {
  /* ... */
} catch (RuntimeException e) {            // Compliant - propagation of the specific exception
  throw e;
} catch (Exception e) {                   // Compliant - catching of the general exception
  LOGGER.error("...", e);
}
</pre>

<p>Catching an exception only to immediately rethrow it without doing anything else is useless and misleading.</p>

<p>The following code snippet illustrates this rule:</p>

<pre>
try {
  /* ... */
} catch (Exception e) {                   // Non-Compliant
  throw e;
}

try {
  /* ... */
} catch (RuntimeException e) {            // Compliant - propagation is allowed
  throw e;
} catch (Exception e) {
  throw new BusinessException("...", e);
}
</pre>

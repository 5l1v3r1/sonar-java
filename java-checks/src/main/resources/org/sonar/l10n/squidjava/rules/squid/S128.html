<p>
When the execution is not explicitly terminated at the end of a switch case, it continues to execute the statements of the following case.
While this is sometimes intentional, it often is a mistake which leads to unexpected behavior.
</p>

<p>This rule doesn't apply to empty cases. Indeed those empty cases allow you to specify the same behavior for a group of cases.</p>

<p>The following code snippet illustrates this rule:</p>

<pre>
switch (myVariable) {
  case 0:                                // Compliant
  case 1:                                // Compliant
    doSomething();
    break;
  case 2:                                // Compliant
    return;
  case 3:                                // Compliant
    throw new IllegalStateException();
  case 4:                                // Non-Compliant - both 'doSomething()' and 'doSomethingElse()' will be executed
    doSomething();
  default:                               // Non-Compliant
    doSomethingElse();
}
</pre>

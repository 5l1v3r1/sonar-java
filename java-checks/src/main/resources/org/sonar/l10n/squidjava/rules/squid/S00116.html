Sharing some naming conventions is a key point to make it possible for a team to efficiently collaborate. This rule allows to check that all field names match a provided regular expression.

The following code snippet illustrates this rule:

<pre>
public class MyClass {
  public int FIRST = 1; // Non-Compliant
  public int second = 2; // Compliant
}
</pre>

<p>
Duplicated string literals are error-prone to refactor, as one must pay attention to update all occurrences.
Constants can be referenced from many places, but there value is updated in a single place.
</p>

<p>The following code:</p>

<pre>
public void run() {
  prepare("action1");                              // Non-Compliant - "action1" is duplicated 3 times
  execute("action1");
  release("action1");
}

@SuppressWarning("all")                            // Compliant - annotations are excluded
private void method1(} { /* ... */ }
@SuppressWarning("all")
private void method2(} { /* ... */ }

public String method3(String a) {
  System.out.println("'" + a + "'");               // Compliant - literal "'" has less than 5 characters and is excluded
  return "";                                       // Compliant - literal "" has less than 5 characters and is excluded
}
</pre>

<p>should be refactored into:</p>

<pre>
private static final String ACTION_1 = "action1";  // Compliant

public void run() {
  prepare(ACTION_1);                               // Compliant
  execute(ACTION_1);
  release(ACTION_1);
}
</pre>

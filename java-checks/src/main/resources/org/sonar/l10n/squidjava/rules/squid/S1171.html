<p>
Non-static initializers is a rarely used Java feature which can be confusing to most developers.
When possible, they should be refactored into standard constructors or field initializers.
</p>

<p>The following code:</p>

<pre>
public class MyClass {

  private final Date date;

  {                                      // Non-Compliant
    date = new Date();
  }

}
</pre>

<p>should be refactored into:</p>

<pre>
public class MyClass {

  private final Date date = new Date();  // Compliant

}
</pre>
